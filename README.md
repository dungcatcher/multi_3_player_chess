- Players move in an anti-clockwise order, starting from white. i.e. white then black then red.
- Pawns move the same as they do in regular chess, except once they leave their home segment, they gain the ability to move sideways. They promote on the back rows of the other player segments.
- A knight jumps in a familiar 'L' shape, moving 2 squares orthogonally in the same direction, then moving to the side one square.
- A piece moving diagonally through the center has its paths split into two.
- A player in stalemate loses the turn to move until another opponent releases the stalemate condition.
- If a player is placed in checkmate they lose the right to move for the rest of the game and become a spectator.
- The game is won be the last player remaining, where both other kings are in checkmate.
- The game is drawn by the two remaining players if the other king is in stalemate.
